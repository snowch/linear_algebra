### Linear independence

> In the previous section, questions about the existence of solutions of a linear system led to the concept of the span of a set of vectors. In particular, the span of a set of vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$ is the set of vectors $b$ for which a solution to the linear system $[ v_1 v_2 ... v_n ]x = b$  exists.

> In this section, we turn to **the uniqueness of solutions** of a linear system, the second of our two fundamental questions. This will lead us to the concept of linear independence.
