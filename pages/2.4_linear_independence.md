### Linear independence

> In the previous section, questions about the existence of solutions of a linear system led to the concept of the span of a set of vectors. In particular, the span of a set of vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$ is the set of vectors $b$ for which a solution to the linear system $[ v_1 v_2 ... v_n ]x = b$  exists.

> In this section, we turn to **the uniqueness of solutions** of a linear system, the second of our two fundamental questions. This will lead us to the concept of linear independence.

#### Linear dependence

**Definition 2.4.5.**  A set of vectors is called linearly dependent if one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others. Otherwise, the set of vectors is called linearly independent.

#### How to recognize linear dependence

**Proposition 2.4.6.**  The columns of a matrix are linearly independent if and only if every column contains a pivot position.

**Proposition 2.4.7.**  A linearly independent set of vectors in $`ℝ^m`$ contains at most $m$ vectors.

**Example:**

```text
Matrix: 

⎡2  1   -1⎤
⎢         ⎥
⎢2  1   0 ⎥
⎢         ⎥
⎣0  -1  1 ⎦

RREF: 

⎡1  0  0⎤
⎢       ⎥
⎢0  1  0⎥
⎢       ⎥
⎣0  0  1⎦

The matrix has linearly independent columns.

Matrix: 

⎡2  1   -5⎤
⎢         ⎥
⎢2  1   -5⎥
⎢         ⎥
⎣0  -1  1 ⎦

RREF: 

⎡1  0  -2⎤
⎢        ⎥
⎢0  1  -1⎥
⎢        ⎥
⎣0  0  0 ⎦

The matrix has linearly dependent columns.
```

For the last matrix, $w3 = -2w1 - w2$

from sympy import Matrix, pprint

def linearly_dependent_columns(matrix):
    nullspace = matrix.nullspace()
    
    print("Matrix: \n")
    pprint(matrix)
    print()
    print("RREF: \n")
    pprint(matrix.rref()[0])
    print()

    # If null space is not empty, the columns are linearly dependent
    if nullspace:
        print("The matrix has linearly dependent columns.\n")
        return True
    else:
        print("The matrix has linearly independent columns.\n")
        return False

A = Matrix([
    [2,  1, -1],
    [2,  1,  0],
    [0, -1,  1]
])
linearly_dependent_columns(A)


B = Matrix([
    [2,  1, -5],
    [2,  1, -5],
    [0, -1,  1]
])
linearly_dependent_columns(B)
```

#### Homogeneous equations

If $A$ is a matrix, we call the equation $Ax = 0$ a homogeneous equation.

**Proposition 2.4.9.**  For a matrix $A = [ v_1 v_2 ... v_n ]$, the following statements are equivalent:
- The columns of $A$ are linearly dependent.
- One of the vectors in the set $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$ is a linear combination of the others.
- The matrix $A$ has a column without a pivot position.
- The homogeneous equation $Ax = 0$ has infinitely many solutions and hence a nonzero solution.
- There are weights $c_1, c_2, ... c_n$, not all of which are zero, such that $c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n = 0$.
