### Matrix transformations

**Definition 2.5.3.**  The matrix transformation associated to the matrix $A$ is the function that assigns to the vector $x$ the vector $Ax$; that is, $T(x) = Ax$.

**Proposition 2.5.6.**  If $`T: ℝ^n \to ℝ^m`$ is a matrix transformation given by $T(x) = Ax, then the matrix $A$ has columns $T(e_j)$; that is, $`A = [ T(e_1) ; T(e_2) \; \cdots \; T(e_n) ]`$.
