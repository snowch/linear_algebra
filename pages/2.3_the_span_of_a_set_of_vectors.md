### The span of a set of vectors

We now return to our two fundamental questions, rephrased here in terms of matrix multiplication.
- Existence: Is there a solution to the equation $Ax = b$?
- Uniqueness: If there is a solution to the equation $Ax = b$, is it unique?

In this section, we focus on the **existence question** and see how it leads to the concept of the span of a set of vectors.

**Notation 2.3.9**.  We will denote the span of the set of vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$ by Span$`\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}.`$

**Definition 2.3.1.**  The span of a set of vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$ is the set of all linear combinations that can be formed from the vectors.

Alternatively, if  $A = [ v_1 v_2 ... v_n ]$, then the span of the vectors consists of all vectors $b$ for which the equation $Ax = b$ is consistent.

### Pivot positions and span

> To summarize, we looked at the pivot positions in a matrix whose columns are the **three-dimensional** vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$. We found that with
> - one pivot position, the span was a line.
> - two pivot positions, the span was a plane.
> - three pivot positions, the span was $`ℝ^3`$.

**Proposition 2.3.14.**  Suppose we have vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$ in $`ℝ^m`$. Then Span$`\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\} = ℝ^m`$ if and only if the matrix $[ v_1, v_2, ..., v_n ]$ has a pivot position in every row.

> This tells us something important about the number of vectors needed to span $`ℝ^m`$. Suppose we have $n$ vectors $[ v_1, v_2, ..., v_n ]$ that span $`ℝ^m`$. The proposition tells us that the matrix $A = [ v_1 v_2 ... v_n ]$ has a pivot position in every row, such as in this reduced row echelon matrix.

```math
\begin{equation*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
1 \; 0 \; * \; 0 \; * \; 0 \\
0 \; 1 \; * \; 0 \; * \; 0 \\
0 \; 0 \; 0 \; 1 \; * \; 0 \\
0 \; 0 \; 0 \; 0 \; 0 \; 1 \\
\end{array}\right].
\end{equation*}
```

> Since a matrix can have at most one pivot position in a column, there must be at least as many columns as there are rows, which implies that $`n\geq m`$. For instance, if we have a set of vectors that span $`ℝ^632`$., there must be at least 632 vectors in the set.


**Proposition 2.3.15.**  A set of vectors whose span is $`ℝ^m`$ contains at least $m$ vectors.

 **Terminology**.

Because span is a concept that is connected to a set of vectors, we say, “The span of the set of vectors 
$v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ is ....” While it may be tempting to say, “The span of the matrix $A$ is ...,” we should instead say “The span of the columns of the matrix $A$ is ....”
