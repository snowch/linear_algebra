### The span of a set of vectors

We now return to our two fundamental questions, rephrased here in terms of matrix multiplication.
- Existence: Is there a solution to the equation $Ax = b$?
- Uniqueness: If there is a solution to the equation $Ax = b$, is it unique?

In this section, we focus on the **existence question** and see how it leads to the concept of the span of a set of vectors.

**Notation 2.3.9**.  We will denote the span of the set of vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$ by Span$`\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}.`$

**Definition 2.3.1.**  The span of a set of vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$ is the set of all linear combinations that can be formed from the vectors.

Alternatively, if  $A = [ v_1, v_2, ..., v_n ]$, then the span of the vectors consists of all vectors $b$ for which the equation $Ax = b$ is consistent.

### Pivot positions and span

**Proposition 2.3.14.**  Suppose we have vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_n$ in $`ℝ^m`$. Then Span$`\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\} = ℝ^m`$ if and only if the matrix $[ v_1, v_2, ..., v_n ]$ has a pivot position in every row.

**Proposition 2.3.15.**  A set of vectors whose span is $`ℝ^m`$ contains at least $m$ vectors.

 ---

 **Terminology**.

Because span is a concept that is connected to a set of vectors, we say, “The span of the set of vectors 
$v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ is ....” While it may be tempting to say, “The span of the matrix $A$ is ...,” we should instead say “The span of the columns of the matrix $A$ is ....”
