Proof: solution sets can always be parametrized using the free variables. 

**Base Case (n=1):** Consider a single linear equation:

\[ a_1x_1 = b \]

If \(x_1\) is a free variable, then the solution set can be expressed as \(x_1 = \frac{b}{a_1}\), which is a parametric representation.

**Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds true for systems of \(n\) linear equations. We want to prove it for \(n+1\) equations.

Consider a system of \(n+1\) linear equations:

\[ 
\begin{cases}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \dots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \dots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_{(n+1)1}x_1 + a_{(n+1)2}x_2 + \dots + a_{(n+1)n}x_n = b_{n+1}
\end{cases}
\]

Assume there are \(k\) free variables.

**Case 1:** If \(k = 0\), all variables are bound variables, and the solution set is either empty or a single point, which can be trivially parametrized.

**Case 2:** If \(k > 0\), at least one variable, say \(x_n\), is a free variable. 

Now, let's focus on the first \(n\) equations. Since there are \(k\) free variables, we can express the remaining \(n - k\) variables in terms of these \(k\) free variables. This is possible because each equation reduces the dimensionality of the solution space by 1.

Now, consider the \(n+1\)th equation. Since the first \(n - k\) variables are expressed in terms of the free variables, the equation is only dependent on the \(k\) free variables. We can express one of the variables (let's say \(x_n\)) in terms of the other \(k - 1\) free variables.

Thus, we have expressed all \(n+1\) variables in terms of the \(k\) free variables, completing the induction step.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all systems of linear equations.
