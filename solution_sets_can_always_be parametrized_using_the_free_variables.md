**Proof**: Solution sets of a homogenous system can always be parametrized using the free variables.

Let's prove this statement using mathematical induction.

Sure, I can guide you through proving this statement using mathematical induction. Let's denote $` S `$ as the solution set of a homogeneous system of linear equations, and let $` n `$ be the number of equations and variables in the system.

### Base Case:
For $` n = 1 `$, the system consists of one equation with one variable. If the equation is homogeneous, it will always have a trivial solution, where the variable is multiplied by zero. Thus, the solution set $` S `$ can be parametrized using the free variable.

### Inductive Hypothesis:
Assume that for some $` k `$, where $` k \geq 1 `$, the statement holds true for all systems with $` k `$ equations and $` k `$ variables, i.e., the solution set of a homogeneous system with $` k `$ equations can be parametrized using the free variables.

### Inductive Step:
We want to show that the statement holds true for $` k + 1 `$ equations and $` k + 1 `$ variables.

Consider a homogeneous system of $` k + 1 `$ equations and $` k + 1 `$ variables. We can rewrite this system as follows:

$` \begin{align*}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1k}x_k + a_{1,k+1}x_{k+1} &= 0 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2k}x_k + a_{2,k+1}x_{k+1} &= 0 \\
& \vdots \\
a_{k+1,1}x_1 + a_{k+1,2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{k+1,k}x_k + a_{k+1,k+1}x_{k+1} &= 0
\end{align*} `$

Now, let's isolate the last equation:

$` a_{k+1,1}x_1 + a_{k+1,2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{k+1,k}x_k + a_{k+1,k+1}x_{k+1} = 0 `$

This equation can be written as:

$` x_{k+1} = -\frac{a_{k+1,1}}{a_{k+1,k+1}}x_1 - \frac{a_{k+1,2}}{a_{k+1,k+1}}x_2 - \cdots - \frac{a_{k+1,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}}x_k `$

Since $` x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k `$ are free variables by our inductive hypothesis, we can denote $` x_i = t_i `$ for $` i = 1, 2, \ldots, k `$, where $` t_i `$ are arbitrary parameters. Substituting these into the equation for $` x_{k+1} `$, we get:

$` x_{k+1} = -\frac{a_{k+1,1}}{a_{k+1,k+1}}t_1 - \frac{a_{k+1,2}}{a_{k+1,k+1}}t_2 - \cdots - \frac{a_{k+1,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}}t_k `$

Thus, $` x_{k+1} `$ can also be parametrized using the free variables $` t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k `$.

This completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds true for all $` n \geq 1 `$. Therefore, the solution sets of homogeneous systems can always be parametrized using the free variables.
