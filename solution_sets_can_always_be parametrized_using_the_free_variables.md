**Proof**: solution sets can always be parametrized using the free variables. 

Let's prove this statement using mathematical induction.

**Claim:** Given a system of linear equations, the solution sets can always be parametrized using the free variables.

**Basis Step:** 
For a system of linear equations with only one equation and one variable, it's trivial. Let's denote the variable as $`x_1`$. If the equation is $`ax_1 = b`$, where $`a`$ and $`b`$ are constants and $`a \neq 0`$, then the solution set is $`\{ \frac{b}{a} \}`$, which can be represented as $`x_1 = \frac{b}{a}`$. Since there are no free variables, there's no parametrization needed.

**Inductive Hypothesis:** 
Assume that the statement is true for a system of $`k`$ linear equations with $`k`$ variables. That is, we can parametrize the solution set using the free variables.

**Inductive Step:** 
Now, consider a system of $`(k + 1)`$ linear equations with $`(k + 1)`$ variables. We want to show that if the statement holds for $`k`$, it also holds for $`(k + 1)`$.

Let the system of equations be represented as:

$`
\begin{align*}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1k}x_k + a_{1(k+1)}x_{k+1} &= b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2k}x_k + a_{2(k+1)}x_{k+1} &= b_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_{(k+1)1}x_1 + a_{(k+1)2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{(k+1)k}x_k + a_{(k+1)(k+1)}x_{k+1} &= b_{k+1} \\
\end{align*}
`$

As per the inductive hypothesis, we assume that the solution set can be parametrized using the first $`k`$ variables $`x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k`$. Let's denote the solution set by $`S_k`$. So, the solution set for the first $`k`$ equations can be represented as $`S_k = \{ x_1 = f_1(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m), x_2 = f_2(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m), \ldots, x_k = f_k(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m) \}`$, where $`t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m`$ are the parameters.

Now, let's consider the $`(k + 1)`$-th equation:

$`[ a_{(k+1)1}x_1 + a_{(k+1)2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{(k+1)k}x_k + a_{(k+1)(k+1)}x_{k+1} = b_{k+1} ]`$

We can rewrite this equation as:

$`[ a_{(k+1)1}f_1(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m) + a_{(k+1)2}f_2(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m) + \cdots + a_{(k+1)k}f_k(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m) + a_{(k+1)(k+1)}x_{k+1} = b_{k+1} ]`$

Now, we can solve for $`x_{k+1}`$:

$`[ x_{k+1} = \frac{b_{k+1} - a_{(k+1)1}f_1(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m) - a_{(k+1)2}f_2(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m) - \cdots - a_{(k+1)k}f_k(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m)}{a_{(k+1)(k+1)}} ]`$

This expression for $`x_{k+1}`$ clearly depends on the parameters $`t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m`$, thus $`x_{k+1}`$ can also be parametrized. Therefore, the statement holds for $`(k + 1)`$ equations.

By mathematical induction, the statement holds true for any number of linear equations, and hence, the solution sets can always be parametrized using the free variables.
