### Matrix multiplication and linear combinations

---

**Definition 2.2.2.** Matrix-vector multiplication.  The product of a matrix $A$ by a vector $x$ will be the linear combination of the columns of $A$ using the components of $x$ as weights. More specifically, if
    
$`\begin{equation*}
A=\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
v_1 \; v_2 \; \ldots \; v_n
\end{array}\right],~~~
x = \left[\begin{array}{r}
c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{array}\right],
\end{equation*}`$
 
then

$`\begin{equation*}
Ax = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \ldots + c_nv_n\text{.}
\end{equation*}`$

If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, then $x$ must be an $n$-dimensional vector, and the product $Ax$ will be an $m$-dimensional vector.

**Proposition 2.2.3.** Linearity of matrix multiplication.  If $A$ is a matrix, $v$ and $w$ vectors of the appropriate dimensions, and $c$ a scalar, then

- $`A0 = 0`$
- $`A(cv) = cAv`$
- $`A(v + w) = Av + Aw`$

 #### Matrix-matrix products

**Definition 2.2.6**. Matrix-matrix multiplication.  Given matrices 
 and ,
 we form their product 
 by first writing 
 in terms of its columns
 
ðŸ”—and then defining

 **Observation 2.2.8.**  It is important to note that we can only multiply matrices if the shapes of the matrices are compatible. More specifically, when constructing the product ,
 the matrix 
 multiplies the columns of .
 Therefore, the number of columns of 
 must equal the number of rows of .
 When this condition is met, the number of rows of 
 is the number of rows of ,
 and the number of columns of 
 is the number of columns of .

**Properties of Matrix-matrix Multiplication.**
ðŸ”—
ðŸ”—If ,
 ,
 and 
 are matrices such that the following operations are defined, it follows that
Associativity:
ðŸ”—.
Distributivity:
ðŸ”—.
ðŸ”—.

**Caution.**
ðŸ”—
ðŸ”—The following properties hold for real numbers but not for matrices.
Commutativity:
ðŸ”—It is not generally true that .
Cancellation:
ðŸ”—It is not generally true that 
 implies that .
Zero divisors:
ðŸ”—It is not generally true that 
 implies that either 
 or .
