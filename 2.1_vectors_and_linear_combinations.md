### Vectors and linear combinations

#### Vectors

> **Observation 2.1.8.**  Even though these vector operations are new, it is straightforward to check that some familiar properties hold.
> 
> Commutativity: $v + w = w + v$
> 
> Distributivity $a(v + w) = av + aw$

#### Linear Combinations

> **Definition 2.1.9.**  The **_linear combination_** of the vectors $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n$ with scalars $c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n$ is the vector:
>
> $$$c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \ldots + c_nv_n$$
> 
> The scalars $c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n$ are called the **_weights_** of the linear combination
