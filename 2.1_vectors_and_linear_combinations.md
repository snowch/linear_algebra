### Vectors and linear combinations

#### Vectors

> **Observation 2.1.8.**  Even though these vector operations are new, it is straightforward to check that some familiar properties hold.
> 
> Commutativity: $v + w = w + v$
> 
> Distributivity $a(v + w) = av + aw$

#### Linear Combinations

> **Definition 2.1.9.**  The linear combination of the vectors $\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n$
 with scalars 
 is the vector
.
ðŸ”—The scalars 
 are called the weights of the linear combination
